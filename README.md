# Dqlite for Kubernetes

This project is a drop in replacement for etcd on Kubernetes.

If you are looking for an in-memory database to replace etcd in your
K8s cluster dqlite might be just right for you. Here is what you are getting:

- distributed sqlite
- in-memory
- high availability
- almost zero ops

## Building

`k8s-dqlite` links with [`dqlite`](https://github.com/canonical/dqlite). It is recommended to build static binaries, by running:

```
make static
./bin/static/k8s-dqlite --help
```

If required, you can also build dynamically linked binaries (this requires the dqlite shared libraries and dependencies to be present when running `k8s-dqlite` afterwards):

```
make dynamic
./bin/dynamic/k8s-dqlite --help
```

## Installing

Prepare a directory containing:

- `init.yaml` with `Address: <host_IP>:<port_used_by_dqlite>`
- `cluster.crt` and `cluster.key` pair.

Here is a script to build you can use:

```
mkdir -p /var/data/
IP="127.0.0.1"
PORT="29001"
DNS=$(/bin/hostname)

echo "Address: $IP:$PORT" > /var/data/init.yaml
mkdir -p /var/tmp/

# Find the csr-dqlite.conf.template in the project
cp /config/csr-dqlite.conf.template /var/tmp/csr-dqlite.conf
sed -i 's/HOSTNAME/'"${DNS}"'/g' /var/tmp/csr-dqlite.conf
sed -i 's/HOSTIP/'"${IP}"'/g' /var/tmp/csr-dqlite.conf
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -keyout /var/data/cluster.key -out ${SNAP_DATA}/var/data/cluster.crt -subj "/CN=k8s" -config /var/tmp/csr-dqlite.conf -extensions v3_ext
chmod -R o-rwX /var/data
```

You are now ready to start `k8s-dqlite` with:

```
k8s-dqlite --storage-dir=/var/data/
```

The `--listen` option allows you to set the endpoint where dqlite should listen to for connections from kubernetes API server.
By default `k8s-dqlite` will be listening for connections at `tcp://127.0.0.1:12379`.

The snap package takes care of this installation step so you may want to use the snap you build above:

```
sudo snap install ./k8s-dqlite_latest_amd64.snap --classic --dangerous
```

## Configuring the API server

To point the API server to `k8s-dqlite` use the following arguments:

```
# Endpoint k8s-dqlite listens at
--etcd-servers="http://<IP>:<PORT>"
# By default --etcd-servers="http://127.0.0.1:12379"

# Point to the cluster key pair
--etcd-certfile=/data/cluster.crt
--etcd-keyfile=/var/data/cluster.key

# If you are using the snap comment in these lines
#--etcd-certfile=/var/snap/k8s-dqlite/current/var/data/cluster.crt
#--etcd-keyfile=/var/snap/k8s-dqlite/current/var/data/cluster.key
```

## Highly Available Dqlite

The following steps allows one to setup a highly available dqlite backend.

In the example below, we will setup a 3 node HA dqlite.

Steps:

1. On the main node, make sure that this node is listening to the default network interface.
2. On the joining node and after installing k8s-dqlite, you need to backup the dqlite data directory for example (`/var/data`).
3. Delete the dqlite data directory.
4. Copy the `cluster.crt` and `cluster.key` from the main node and place it into the joining node's `/var/data`.
5. Create the `init.yaml` file with the following content

  ```yaml
  Cluster:
  - <the ip of the main node>:29001
  Address: <ip of the joining node>:29001
  ```

6. Start `k8s-dqlite` process

  ```shell
  k8s-dqlite --storage-dir=/var/data/
  ```

7. Go to the main node and verify that the joining node is visible from the dqlite cluster.

  ```shell
  dqlite -s file:///var/data/cluster.yaml -c /var/data/cluster.crt -k /var/data/cluster.key -f json k8s .cluster
  ```

8. Repeat from step #2 to join another node.

## Develop k8s-dqlite against an active MicroK8s instance

1. Install development tools:

    ```bash
    sudo snap install go --classic
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential -y
    ```

2. Clone k8s-dqlite repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/canonical/k8s-dqlite
    ```

3. Install MicroK8s on the machine:

    ```bash
    sudo snap install microk8s --classic
    ```

4. Wait for MicroK8s to come up:

    ```bash
    sudo microk8s status --wait-ready
    ```

5. Stop k8s-dqlite included in the snap:

    ```bash
    sudo snap stop microk8s.daemon-k8s-dqlite --disable
    ```

6. Run k8s-dqlite from this repository:

    ```bash
    cd k8s-dqlite
    make static
    sudo ./bin/static/k8s-dqlite \
      --storage-dir /var/snap/microk8s/current/var/kubernetes/backend \
      --listen unix:///var/snap/microk8s/current/var/kubernetes/backend/kine.sock:12379
    ```

7. While developing and making changes to `k8s-dqlite`, just restart k8s-dqlite

Note: When developing k8s-dqlite against Canonical Kubernetes use the following flags:

- `--storage-dir /var/snap/k8s/common/var/lib/k8s-dqlite`
- `--listen unix:///var/snap/k8s/common/var/lib/k8s-dqlite/k8s-dqlite.sock`
